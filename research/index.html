                <h1>A Tool to Reduce Defects due to Dependencies between HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3</h1>                

                <hr>                

                <p>One of the most common errors developers make is to provide incorrect string identifiers across the HTML-JavaScript-CSS stack. The existing literature[1][2][3] shows that a significant percentage of defects observed in real-world codebases belong to this category. This research project is concerned with the existence of defects due to dependencies between HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3, specifically syntactic errors in string identifiers. Furthermore, the proposed solution will attempt to reduce the delta (time or cost) between defect injection and defect discovery by implementing a dedicated just-in-time syntactic string identifier resolution tool that constructs a symbol table to manage such dependencies.</p>

                <p class="lead">Problem</p>
                <p>While writing a front-end web application, a developer has to keep a track of the DOM in the HTML, the associated JavaScript and the associated CSS stylesheets as well. Because of this interplay, there are a lot of “syntactic” dependencies created. The figure above can help better illustrate the concept of “syntactic” dependencies. The developer has to keep track of how the DOM accesses the JavaScript and vice-versa, how the DOM accesses the CSS stylesheet and vice-versa, how the JavaScript accesses the CSS stylesheet and vice-versa. The figure illustrates the concept at a very small scale. For example, the button in “index.html” has an onclick event that calls the “getSomeData()” method in the “myScript.js” file. Similarly, the “myScripts.js” file attempts to manipulate the content of the DOM by accessing the “serverResponse” DOM element by its ID. The div that contains the button uses a style “myCssClass” as defined in the “theme.css” file. So even in about 20 lines of code, it is very easy to see the nature of these dependencies. And the developer can easily make the error resolving these dependencies. These errors can range from typographical errors to non-existent constructs like ID and functions, etc. It becomes very difficult for the developer to keep track of such dependencies as the size of the codebase increases. It is essential to note that in all of the modern web applications, these three languages work in parallel, making them prone to dependency related defects. Ocariza, et al.[2] found that most of such defects (specifically JavaScript) are injected by the programmers in the code itself. We will further explore the errors found in real-world codebases and how it maps to these dependencies in the literature review section.                
                </p>                
                <p class="lead">Current Practices</p>
                <p>Currently, the most common method used by developers to test such dependencies is to run the code on the browser, see the results and look for any error message in the console or any undesirable behavior in their application. The most common tools for such purpose is either the Google Chrome Dev tools or Firefox Firebug. There are different components of these tools that help the developer map the dependencies and find the defects if any. In most cases, any JavaScript related defect is directly caught by looking at the “console” view. But CSS related defects can only be found through a visual inspection of either the functionality of the module or through a code inspection. This round trip is not only an overhead adding to the development time and cost, but is also very error-prone.
                </p>                

                <p class="lead">Proposed Solution</p>
                <p>As a solution to the problem, we propose a static analysis tool to identify dependencies between HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. To achieve this, we use different parsers to parse these languages and keep a track of dependencies. Like any other static anaylsis tool, this tool comes in two forms - command line and integrated plugin with an IDE. Eclipse was the IDE chosen.</p>

                <p class="lead">User Study</p>
                <p> As a part of validation, we would like to request you to take part in a very small and quick user study. In this user study, you will be asked to add a set of features to an existing codebase. These are very small features that focus on the dependencies discussed above. You will also be asked to self-report certain values and take part in a post-study survey.
                </p>

                        </li>
                        <li> Import the project into Eclipse.
                        </li>                        
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p class="lead">Features</p>
                <p> Please implement each of the following features one at a time. Before beginning any feature, use any stopwatch and start the timer. During implementation, please keep an eye out for any defects that you might inject. Do not fix the defects when injected, just make a note of the time from the stopwatch. Once you are done implementing the entire featue, use the tool to find defects. If anything is reported, consider this to be defect discovery time and make a note of the time from the stopwatch. Finally, fix the defect and make a note of the time - this is defect fix time. Repeat this for every feature. Note : not all features might inject defects. Use this form to report your findings - provide form link here.

                <p>Hello Developer! You are the Lead Engineer of a brand new startup that is going to change the world. Like every other startup, a presence on the web is desirable. The founder of the startup has found a template that she likes and wants you to make changes to this template before you can launch your website. Below is a list of changes, show them that you are the best Lead Developer out there!<p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> <strong>Change the text! (find these in the HTML and edit directly)</strong>
                            On the top left of the screen,change the text from “Start Bootstrap” to “Awesome Startup!”<br>
                            Change the text on the centre of the screen that says “Landing Page” to “Welcome!” and the text that says “A Template by Start Bootstrap” to “To the awesome Startup!”<br>
                            At the bottom, change the text that says “Connect to Start Bootstrap” to “Connect with Us”.<br>
                            Finally, change the copyright text at the bottom from “Copyright © Your Company 2014” to “Copyright © Awesome Startup 2016”
                        </li>
                        <li> <strong>Change the links!</strong> The links for Twitter, GitHub and LinkedIn are pointing to places we don’t want! Instead, let’s just redirect all those links to my.asu.edu. First, find and remove the links in href for each of these buttons. Add onclick methods to each of these buttons. Next, create a new JavaScript file and include it inside the head tag. (hint : <code>&lt;script src="jsfilename.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>) In this new JavaScript file, define the onclick methods called in step b. Add code to open a new window that redirects to https://www.asu.edu. (hint : use window.open("https://www.asu.edu"); )
                        </li>
                        <li> <strong>Add a portfolio section!</strong> In the top right of the html page, add a new list item called portfolio. After line 59 in index.html, add the following(copy and paste, and ensure to keep the new lines and indents, you don’t want to be a bad programmer!)
                            <pre>
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;a href="#portfolio"&gt;Portfolio&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;</pre>
                            Now, you need to create a new section called portfolio. On  line 171, add the following(again, keep the new lines and indents)
                            <pre>
&lt;a name="portfolio"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class="content-section-b"&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
        &lt;div class="row"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is our portfolio!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>            
                        </li>
                        <li> <strong>Add a “See More” button in the portfolio!</strong> In line 176, add the button! Use <code>&lt;a id=”seemore” class="btn btn-default btn-lg"&gt;&lt;span&gt;See More&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                        </li>
                        <li> <strong>On clicking “See More”, add some text in the portfolio section!</strong> Add an onclick method in the button above. Name the method <code>seemoreBtnClick</code>. In your JavaScript file, add method called <code>seeMoreBtnClick</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li> <strong>Add some more text in “Portfolio” section!</strong> The see more button doesn’t really do something above. Add some text that is shown once that button is clicked. Add a new p tag below the button in the portfolio section. Give it an id called <code>portfoliodescription</code>. In the method defined in step above, add code that will add some text to the p tag created in step 6a. So, in the method, add the following code :
<pre>var elem = document.getElementById("portfolioDescription");
elem.innerHTML = "This is some more description in the portfolio!";
</pre>
                        </li>
                        <li> <strong>Change the text of button whenever it is clicked!</strong> The “See More” button should say “Show Less” when clicked. In the method defined in step 5, get a reference to the “See More” button by using the <code>getElementById</code> method in the document object. Further, get a reference to the span tag and update the innerText of the span tag to say “Show Less”.
                        </li>
                        <li> <strong>The font doesn’t look good!</strong> In the portfolio section, the font of the text looks odd and doesn’t fit in with the whole website. Let’s use one of the pre-built fonts and add it to this section. Add the class “lea” to the p tags in the portfolio section. Just change the HTML directly!
                        </li>
                        <li> <strong>The background doesn’t look good!</strong> You don’t like the background! The background doesn’t look good! Let’s just go ahead and change it. Open landing-page.css file. Change line 38 from <code>background: url(../img/intro-bg.jpg) no-repeat center center;</code> to <code>background: url(../img/landscape-nature-sunset-trees.jpg) no-repeat center center;</code>
                        </li>
                        <li> <strong>Add images to your portfolio!</strong> Add a image to the portfolio section, just below the p tag created in step 6. Use the following code:
                        <pre>
&lt;div class="col-lg-5 col-lg-offset-2 col-sm-6"&gt;
    &lt;img class="img-responsive" src="img/banner-bg.png" alt=""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
                        </li>
                        <li> <strong>Add a Easter Egg!</strong> To the image added in step 10, add an onclick method. Ensure to define the method in the JavaScript file that you had created in step 2. In this method definition, just add an alert method call and pass the text - “You found the Easter Egg!”.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add another Easter Egg! If someone is able to find the easter egg that you created in step 11, change the color of the “See More” button. It can be any color that you wish! Just create a new CSS file, include it in your HTML file, create a new class in that CSS file that sets the background color of the button. In the onclick method defined in step 11, get a reference to the “See More” button by using the document object, and simply add the new class that you just created to the button.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    That’s it, you’re all done!                    
                </p>
